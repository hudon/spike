/home/robert/spike/test/../src/nef_theano/ensemble.py:457: UserWarning: The parameter 'updates' of theano.function() expects an OrderedDict, got <type 'dict'>. Using a standard dictionary here results in non-deterministic behavior. You should use an OrderedDict if you are using Python 2.7, or use a list of (shared, update) pairs. Do not just convert your dictionary to this type before the call as the conversion will still be non-deterministic.
